## Genius-Finance App

## New in week 2:
Louise:
+ dashboard controller
+ stock controller
+ user
+ login/logout with ricardo
+ begin portfolio
+ begin watchlist
+ all of the above need to be tested in week 3, they're interconected which makes it a bit hard to test just one without having the others.


## Test code: 
+ To test our code make sure that all of the code is in the same folder. 
+ run the test_script.py
+ Logging is done in a logging file, you can set level you want to look at in main (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).

## To run the main:
+ This is the scritp that is run when the app is started 
+ run main.py
+ FYI there is no code in here yet.
+ Logging is done in a logging file

## Requirements:
+ Uses python 3.9
+ Uses Yahoo API
